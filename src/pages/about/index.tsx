      <h1>About Freddie</h1>
      <p>
        I am a user-focused developer with over 4 years of professional
        experience in building responsive, data-driven web applications using
        React and TypeScript. I build responsive data-driven web interfaces with
        reusable components and am comfortable refactoring existing projects or
        building from the ground up. I meet project deadlines when requirements
        need to be extended, both independently and within multidisciplinary
        teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a keen appreciation for UX/UI design, demonstrated through my
        initiative in teaching colleagues Figma to improve software design
        processes. My diverse background, including coaching and studying
        osteopathy, enhances my problem-solving and interpersonal skills,
        proving invaluable for delivering features, managing and mentoring
        colleagues and interacting with clients. In my free time, I explore new
        technologies and build projects for charity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I relocated from London to Canberra in 2023 and focussed the time
        applying for permanent residency expanding my back-end skill set, to
        deliver full-stack apps, through online courses and I started a
        part-time bachelor's degree to broaden my understanding of computer
        science.
